<p>
In Salem, Massachusetts with a conservative Puritan colony, the Salem Witch Trials began during the spring of 1692. Due to their religious nature, when a group of young girls suffered fits and seizures, consisting of incoherent wailing and the tossing of items, the only explanation for these absurd actions was possession. The women accused to perform such an act were a foul widow, a slave, and an ill woman who had not attended church in several months. Even after the accusations, the cases of the odd fits did not cease, so the leaders continued to scapegoat others suspected of witchcraft. Close to 20 women and several men were scapegoated and executed in total inside of the colony. One of the best theories explaining the execution and fits of young women was a combination of mass hysteria, extreme religious pressures, and a fungus that grew on the local crops that caused spasms and delusions.
