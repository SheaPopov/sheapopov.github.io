Your friend's mother spreads a rumor that your mother’s apothecary work is witchcraft to keep you from coming near her child. The townspeople refuse to speak to you or your mother, and they only give you dirty looks in public. You’re forced to stay in your house most of the time, but getting by proves to be difficult. People are coming up to you and saying that your mother poisoned your father. Do you...

<h2>
Option 1:
</h2>

<p>
Confront your friend’s mother for spreading rumors.
</p>

<h2>
Option 2:
</h2>

<p>
Ignore it.
