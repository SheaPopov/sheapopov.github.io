Your father recently passed away due to an unknown sickness. He was a farmer on a small farm in the outskirts of Salem. Your mother spent most of her time taking care of the house and cooking for the family. Whenever anyone in the household got sick, it was your motherâ€™s responsibility to care for them. You grew up as the oldest of four siblings, but over the years, each of them has died, leaving you as the last child in the family. Your father resented you for surviving while your brothers fell ill and passed away. You are saddened by his death, but have learned to deal with grief from the death of all of your siblings. Many townsfolk are beginning to worry that they will be infected with whatever killed your father and brothers. Your friend comes over to help out now that you have fewer people in the house. She mentions that her parents are concerned about her spending time with you because of the suspicious circumstance of your father's death. Do you...
